<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;<strong>HOW TO USE CovidU:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: left;">Use the buttons on the left to configure a scenario, and then press "Recompute" to display the scenario results.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">After defining a scenario, you can also get a PDF report with more details on the scenario parameters and outcomes. </li>
<li style="text-align: left;">To examine causal effects of changes, you can define Treatment and Control scenarios, save them on the main tab, and then use the "Causal Effects" tab to see differences in outcomes. </li>
<li style="text-align: left;">On the Causal Effects tab, you can download a PDF report with details on the treatment scenario, the control scenario, and differences between them. </li>
</ul>
